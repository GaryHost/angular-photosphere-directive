Default is 0. Has to be between 0 and 20\r\n                 resolution=\"40\"            // Number of division of the sphere on which is mapped the picture. Default is 30. Has to be between 10 and 80.\r\n                 controls=\"all\">            // Can be 'all', 'wheel', 'pointer' or 'none'. Default is 'all'\r\n    </photosphere>\r\n```    \r\n##Advices\r\n\r\n* Big resolutions values can have effects on the performances.\r\n* Don't use too heavy pictures (like 10 Mo), people don't like to wait...\r\n\r\n##Known bugs\r\n\r\n* Issue with the controls when there are two photospheres on the same page. I'm trying to correct it soon.\r\n\r\n##Coming Soon\r\n* Headtracking control (with webcam)\r\n* LeapMotion control\r\n* Better reaction to resize\r\n* Fullscreen mode\r\n* Setting the fov of the camera\r\n* Fisheye view\r\n\r\n##License","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
